Getting Started
===============

This guide will help you get started using Nibble to publish a comic. It'll go
over all the steps needed to get a comic published:

- `Creating an Account`_
- `Creating a Comic`_
- `Publishing your First Page`_

You'll need a running Nibble installation. For more information on deploying
your own, see Deployment.

Creating an Account
===================

The first thing you'll need is an account on the Nibble instance with which you
plan to publish your comic.

From the main page, click "Sign Up" and enter your username, email address,
and password. Click "Continue" and look for a confirmation email in your inbox.

Follow the instructions in the email to confirm your account and enable
publishing!

Creating a Comic
================

Once you're all logged in, you'll be taken to the Dashboard. Click on the
"Create New Comic" button to start creating a new comic.

You'll need to choose a name and optionally a URL for your comic. Once you're
done, click "Submit"!

Publishing your First Page
==========================

On the comic dashboard, click the "New Page" button. Fill in the title and
description, and add at least one image. You can choose to publish the page at
a scheduled time, but for now just click "Publish".

That's it! You can view your new page by clicking on "View" next to your
new page in the list.
